Flash Pretty Please version 1.0
---------------------------------
Installation
Unzip Flash Pretty Please in the /wp-content/plugin/ area of your website

Customization
Flash Pretty Please comes with a custom message popup. You can easily customize it from your wordpress dashboard under setting -> Flash Pretty Please
 
Note: If you use a directory path other than /wp-content/plugin/ it will cause the css and js file not to work. We are going to have this fixed soon.
